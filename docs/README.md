A card game written in c , with a basic bot as the  other player. [Rules.](rules.md)
## Prerequisites

     [cmake](https://cmake.org/) (vers. > 3.0.0) \
     [ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja)

 to run: \
  [for windows mingw should be installed, but no promises](https://dev.to/gamegods3/how-to-install-gcc-in-windows-10-the-easier-way-422j)

## What if I want to change something?
The deck_config file is here! \
You can change the characters that appear in the middle of the card, the printinfg of it and values that are presented.
Some options I advice not to change, like max values and deck sizes. 
You will need to build the program again if you want settings to change.
